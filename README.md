# solving-a-quadratic-equation-by-thinking-like-a-human
You can easily write a code that solves a quadratic equation by using discriminant. But this code solving it like a human who is trying to factorization.  If you're asking why I'm prolonging something that is easily solvable, it's just something I created to test my own math and software skills.  Note: you can only change b and c values here not the a.
